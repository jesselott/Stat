<h3>Analysis 1</h3>
<h4>Legacy vs. Recent: Number of 1,000 yd. Rushers</h4>
<p><span id="vanish1" class="vanish">p-Value = 0.303 / This value is larger than .05, thus the null hypothesis should be accepted.  There is no significant difference in the volume of 1,000 yard rushers in the league. Mu1 = 10.7, Mu2 = 12.3 </span></p>

<h3>Analysis 2</h3>
<h4>Legacy vs. Recent: Rushing Attempts</h4>
<p><span id="vanish2" class="vanish">p-Value = <.0001 / Null hypothesis should be rejected. There were significantly more rushing attempts 30 years ago in the league. Mu1 = 487.3, Mu2 = 421.7</span></p>

<h4>Legacy vs. Recent: Total Wins for Teams with a 1,000 yd. Rusher</h4>
<p><p><span id="vanish3" class="vanish">p-Value = 0.184 / This value is larger than .05, thus the null hypothesis should be accepted. There is no significant difference between wins for teams with 1,000 yard rushers both past and present.<br>Mu1 = 10.7, Mu2 = 12.3</span></p></p>

<h3>Analysis 4</h3>
<h4>Legacy vs. Recent: Super Bowl Champion has 1,000 yd. Rusher on Roster</h4>
<p><p><span id="vanish4" class="vanish">p-Value = 0.06 / This value is larger than .05, thus the null hypothesis should be accepted.  However, this bit of data is misleading, due to the extremely small sample size and the extremely close proximity to 95%.<br>Mu1 = .333, Mu2 = 1.000</span></p></p>
<button class="btn btn-primary" id="btn4">See Results!</button>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<h4>Rushing Attempts and Yards are down significantly, but number of wins and Super Bowls for teams with 1,000 yard rushers are about the same.  I conclude that the null hypothesis cannot be rejected with the amount of data collected.  I plan to further my research this season, and add more data to my continued analysis of this trend.</h4>
